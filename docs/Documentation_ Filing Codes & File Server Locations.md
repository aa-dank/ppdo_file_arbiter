### Formatting for this document

Use Heading formats on filing codes to maintain a nested tree in the document outline. The filing codes with decimals in them use ‘Heading 5’; Integer filing codes use ‘Heading 4’. Text details regarding the filing codes should be ‘Normal Text’ and not appear in the outline.

#### Recurring Archiving Considerations Labels

These are different ‘labels’ used throughout the filing codes documentation:

* **Warning** These describe confusing attributes of files in this filing code or common pitfalls associated with the filing code  
  * **VERY IMPORTANT ARCHIVAL FILES** These flag the filing codes with files which are frequently used. They are subject to additional scrutiny and require additional care to ensure the files are usable (scanned correctly) and not lost.  
    * *Keep for McHenry Archives* These files need to be reboxed for McHenry’s University Archives. Try to maintain their original organization or order but no need to re-staple or re-assemble the files.

  * #### A2   	Working File (FPR/CFR, Famis WO, all beginning documents, original Request, BAS Vice Chancellor Letters, etc.)authorization

    * **Warning:** Projects at this stage may not have been assigned project numbers, thus the documents at this nascent stage in the project may not be labeled with project numbers.

  * #### G11 	Proposal Request (Bulletins) and Contractor's Response

  * #### G12 	Request For Information (RFIs)

    * Requests for information are sent to the university by the contractor when they need some information; maybe they need a decision on what height to install a sink or why they uncovered some conduit when it was not on the drawings they received or how much weight some wall-mounted cabinets will need to hold. Most of the time, the university will pass the RFI off to the consultant/architect to answer.  
      * There are contractual time limits for getting an answer to the contractor and a contractual time limit for getting an answer to the university from the consultant/architect.  
    * There can be many versions of the same RFI: The one received from the contractor, the one including the architect’s response, and maybe a different version that has the university response.  
    * **Warning:** RFIs may have supporting documents including product data, drawings, photos, and spreadsheets that need to be filed in this filing code too. Preferably the supporting documents are included with the corresponding RFI in a single file for archiving.

  * #### G20 	Warranty Deficiency

    * **VERY IMPORTANT ARCHIVAL FILES**

  * #### G21 	Construction Photographs, Video Cassettes, etc.

    * Photo negatives should be labeled with project information and added to box for returning to the warehouse.  
    * *Keep for McHenry Archives* Keep all hard copies of the photos and keep them organized to be sent to the University Archives. Try to preserve information that identifies the project and the dates of the photos.

  * #### G22 	Claims (Legal action including supplementary data) Public Records Act

    * **VERY IMPORTANT ARCHIVAL FILES**  
    * G22.1 Claims – Confidential  
    * G22.2 DIR Investigations/Requests for Information

  * #### G23 	Commissioning

  * #### G24 	Building Permits

   

* ### **H.    	Submittals** (including substitutions) See Project Documents Desk, filed by specification section, manuals

  * **VERY IMPORTANT ARCHIVAL FILES:** There are tons of these files but they are also among the most referenced files, particularly product data submittals and O\&M submittals. Warranties are super import while the warranty is still in effect (generally less than 5 years after project completion). As-builts are super important but need to be filed in F5. Schedules, shop drawings, and test data are not as important.  
  * Submittals are documents that are sent by the contractor to the university to fulfill some part of their contractual obligations detailed in the specification book. They are reviewed by University and the architect/Consultant and then returned back to the contractor with the disposition of the review.  
    * Note this means there can be many versions of the same exact same submittal generated from each. Additionally, rejected submittals result in revisions. (eg we may not like the proposed product being submitted, rejecting it. Subsequently the contractor will send a different product as a revision to the rejected submittal.) We are only interested in archiving the final version of each revision, but will archive intermediate versions when we are unsure a final version exists on the server.  
  * Most submittals are related to the contractors contractual obligation to get confirmation from the university for every product that is ‘installed’ and how it is installed. These are submitted as “Product Data” which show which product will be installed and “**Shop Drawings**” which show how the product will be installed. Also some will have samples or color charts. Shop Drawings are commonly large format.   
  * Submittals are commonly numbered with the section in the specifications they are fulfilling, this is their ‘spec section’.  
  * Besides shop drawings, product data, and samples, submittals also include these things:  
    * Test Reports  
      * Can be filed here or under G8 \- G10  
    * Warranties  
      * **Warning:** *These can be submitted as a submittal but should be archived under G17 filing code.*  
    * O\&M (Operation and Maintenance literature)  
    * Schedules  
      * **Warning:** *These can be submitted as a submittal but should be archived under G3 filing code.*  
    * As-Builts  
      * **Warning:** *These can be submitted as a submittal but should be archived under F5 filing code.*  
    * Samples  
      * Samples are physical examples of things like upholstery, landscaping material, paint swatches etc.  
      * [Documentation for archiving unscannable stuff.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bu4T71ge-00dWURt_oQHZJZhrLer9Q_bJ-m4xdXcJtI/edit#bookmark=id.cx6nmw86m7vk)

# Filing Other Non-project-related Documents

#### Consultant Files

Consultant related files that are *not associated with a project* would be filed under their named directory in N\\PPDO\\Records:\\00xx  Consulting Agreements. Several examples of files that would be filed here include:

* Professional Service Agreements (PSA)  
* Executive Design Professional Agreement (EDPA)

These commonly use the term “Blanket” as in “Blanket Agreement”.

#### Contractor Mini Forms

These are agreements that can be used to hire pre-approved contractors for small projects. Thus they are not associated with any one project. They are located in the folder with their firm name in the following location on the records. There are two types of these: **General Blanket Mini Contracts** and **Blanket Mini Orders**. 

- The General files will be sent once a year and have a title along the lines of “General Contracting Services”. These should be filed in the Contract subfolder of the contractor’s folder (N\\PPDO\\Records:\\02xx   Contractor Blanket Mini Contracts\\”Contractor Name”\\Contract). If the file is not already named, rename it and include the contract number, contractor’s name, “Blanket Mini Contract”, and the year. For example: 0203 T. Boyd Construction Blanket Mini Contract 2022  
    
- The Mini Orders are the contract for a specific project and will have a numbered name (BM0xx). These are filed in the Orders subfolder (N\\PPDO\\Records:\\02xx   Contractor Blanket Mini Contracts\\”Contractor Name”\\Orders). Be sure to include the name of the order and a bit of information about the project. For example: BM055 Science Library Path Paver Repairs.
