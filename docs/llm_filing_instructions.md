# Archiving Location Research for Small Format Files (8.5x11)

Determining which project and filing code a document should be archived under can require some detective work. Broadly, answering these questions can help with that decision.

* Who are the participants in the document?  
  * Are the participants consultants? Contractors?  
    * A document that has an Architect/Design Consultant can only be archived in C \- H.  
    * A document that includes a contractor can only be archived in F \- H  
    * Project participants can be found in the ‘Contracts’ layout of filemaker database  
* Are there any dates on the document?  
  * Dates can be cross referenced with dates of documents in filemaker.   
* The project size can also be helpful. For example, framing would (probably) only be part of a large project. The cost (found on contracts layout in filemaker) is the best way to determine the size of a project.  
  * (Old projects may not have contract info in filemaker)  
* Which filing code is used for the equivalent files in other projects?  
  * Use examples of previously archived documents in other projects as a guide for where to file un-archived files.  
    * Not all files are archived in the correct location and some file locations are somewhat subjective so, sometimes worth referencing multiple project directories for multiple examples and trying to get a consensus on which file code is used for a given document  
  * Examples of well organized projects for reference::  
    * N:\\PPDO\\Records:\\41xx   EH\&S Facility\\4101\\4101  
    * N:\\PPDO\\Records:\\49xx   Long Marine Lab\\4932\\4932

# Large Format Procedure

1. Determine Project Number using Filemaker:   
   1. Confirm that the project number matches FileMakers project entry.  
   2. No Number on the Drawings? Consider using the name of the consultant (Architect) or a date on the drawing to find matching projects  
2. Decipher phase of the drawings (if they have a phase).   
   1. For example, SD, DD, CD, FM approved, DSA Approved, Bid Set, Conformed Set, Record Set.  
      1. EXCEPTION: *“Shop Drawings”* are submittals and are filed under ‘H’  
      2. EXCEPTION: Occasionally, the drawings could be part of other documents. An example being that they could be part of a Change Order or an RFI. They could also be included as an attachment in correspondences.  
   2. Background:   
      1. There is a series of back and forth between the University and the Consultant(Architect) to achieve blueprints for what the university actually wants. Each stage of this process has a different name and corresponding drawings (50%SD, 90%CD, etc)   
      2. After the blueprints show what the University wants built, they need to be approved by the Division of State Architect (DSA Approved/DSA stamped drawings) and the Campus Fire Marshall (FM approved/FM Stamped drawings). Then they are posted online where contractors can Bid on them (Bid set drawings). Based on the bids, some changes may be made to the drawing before they are used in the field, creating the conformed set.  
      3. At the end of the project, the contractor records any differences between the blueprints given to him and the end product into drawings called the *As-Builts*. These are sent to the consultant who then makes one last set of official drawings (and CAD files) that reflect the actual building as it was built, the record set. The record set drawings are the most valuable documents we archive and extreme care should be taken to ensure we archive a quality file.  
      4. Each Drawing Type Explained (These apply to Specifications too):  
         1. *Schematic Design (SD)*, the Architect, designers and consultants develop an outline structure in the owner’s presence. Conceptual plans for the project are developed that show scale, form, and relationships. This phase also requires the Architect to consider permits and jurisdictional requirements for the project.  Schematic Design may include specialty consultants like planners, designers, and other consultants. Engineering teams are involved in this phase at the very end of Schematic Design, or the start of Design Development.  
            2. *Design Development (DD)* phase takes it a step further by planning structural systems, building systems, building materials, etc. Key building components are given the required dimensions, and code compliances are set and confirmed. Construction drawings are developed in this phase based on a set of specifications or instructions for contractors. Schematic Design (SD) may require alterations based on discoveries in the Design Development Phase.  
            3. *Construction documents (CD)* are prepared to document the entire design process. This phase does not include any design changes, and design teams prepare a set of plans and specifications that describe details of the entire project. Construction documents include details about structural and mechanical systems, materials, etc.  
            4. *DSA Approved* → The set that was stamped and approved by the Department of the State Architect. Usually the same as 100CD but with the DSA stamp.  
            5. *FM Stamped/ FM Approved* → This is the 100CD Drawings but with the Stamp from the Fire Marshall. He is the last approval needed before posting the drawings for bidding so, they are frequently the exact same as the Bid Set.  
            6. *Bid Set* → These are the documents that are posted to be bid upon by various contractors and frequently end up being the drawings we print for use on the job site.  
            7. *Conformed Set* → Conformed Drawings include the bid drawings, updated to include all changes made by addendum during the bid process and all awarded alternates.  
3. Determine if the drawings are already on Server. Remember to check that the page counts match. Also be aware that there may be multiple versions of the same document.  
   1. If you determine conclusively that they are already on the server, the hard-copy can be recycled.  
4. Scan Drawings using Plotter  
   1. The scanner can throw an error at any time, losing any scanned data that has not been saved. Don’t scan more than you are prepared to lose. **Save frequently to a file, you can combine the saved pdf files later.**   
      1. Large sets of large-format documents should be scanned in chunks and the chunk files combined to be archived as a single file.  
      2. For very-large sets that may take multiple work-shifts, consider adding a label to the the thumbdrive that the scan is being stored on.  
5. Check scan  
   1. Make sure it is square and that important details are visible on all pages.  
6. If it is a mixed format document, Collate with any small format drawings from the same document. **Both the large and small format pages for a given document need to be archived together in a single file**.  
   1. Examples of mixed format documents include change orders that include drawing of the intended change, correspondences that include referenced drawings as attachments, and shop drawings that were sent with a fax transmittal.  
   2. The HP Pagewide is capable of scanning small format (8.5x11) documents, but it does this very slowly compared to the other scanners.  
   3. [See below for more details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xub4G7-STdRrQsmfLbzuJsgFqC9Zu42qeYVMNM87JXM/edit#bookmark=id.224clmib92gp)  
7. Archive resulting file using the archiving application.
